                Will I receive a certificate of completion or professional
                certification upon finishing a course?

            <p>
              Yes! Upon successful completion of all course modules, projects,
              and final assessments, you will receive an official BUILD SCHOOL
              Certificate of Completion. This is a great credential to share
              on your resume and LinkedIn profile to validate your newly
              acquired skills.

                What equipment or software will I need to participate in the

            <p>
              All you need is a reliable internet connection, a laptop or
              desktop computer, and a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox,
              Edge). Any specialized software required (like a code editor or
              data analysis tools) is either free/open-source or provided to
              you via a temporary educational license.

                What kind of support is available if I get stuck on a
                difficult concept or project?

            </div>
            <p>
              You will never be learning alone! Our support system includes
              dedicated TAs (Teaching Assistants) available during scheduled
              "office hours," an active private student community forum for
              peer-to-peer help, and direct mentorship from your expert
              instructor during live sessions.

              <h3>
                Are there any prerequisites or prior experience needed to
                enroll in the BUILD SCHOOL programs?
              </h3>
              <span class="toggle-icon">+</span>
            </div>
            <p>
              Our courses are designed with various entry points. Our
              "Fundamentals" tracks (like Digital Marketing Fundamentals)
              require zero prior experienceâ€”just a passion to learn!
              "Bootcamp" programs (like Web Development) are intensive and
              recommend a basic understanding of computer literacy, but
              specific technical prerequisites are always listed on the
              individual course pages. fep-zvbr-brf

                How long do I retain access to the course materials and
                lectures after the program ends?

            </div>
            <p>
              We believe in lifelong learning. All enrolled students receive
              lifetime access to the video lectures, downloadable resources,
              project files, and any future updates to the curriculum for the
              course they completed. This ensures you can always refresh your
              knowledge.
